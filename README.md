# 2.5D Tower Defense Game
-It's a tower defense game with a 2D characters in a 3D environment but instead of placing towers, player is a tower.  
-I used Jobs system to optimize enemy managment. Enemies spawns, moves, gets damaged and dies from EnemyManager code.  
-There is different types of enemies and they get stronger in each wave.  
-If an enemy gets the last checkpoint, player takes damage and becames invincible for a second.  
-If player dies, you have the choice to revive him or just restart the game.  
-Play targets nearest enemy and attacks it.  
-Unity Version: 6000.2.3f1
