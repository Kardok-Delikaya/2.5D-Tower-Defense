# 2.5D Tower Defense Game
It's a tower defense game with a 2D characters in a 3D environment but instead of placing towers, player is a tower.
I used Jobs system to optimize enemy managment. Enemies spawns, moves and dies from EnemyManager code.
If an enemy gets the last checkpoint, player takes damage and became invincible for a second.
